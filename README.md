# DMIT2008 Report: Thinking in React
By: Andrew Ng<br>
I am going to do a report on a website I frequent everyday: The seelie.me planner page for a mock representation on how I assume it will work if I were to try to implement it in React.

### Start with a Mock
Here is the page I am going to be analyzing.
<!-- Insert Page Image Here -->
<img src="./mockSource.png">

Functionality on the page:
* Filtering based on the day of the week
* Show/Hide the "Characters" and "Weapons" to display
* Time based task tracker adding/editing/removing
* Time based "Resin" tracker that shows how much you have at a given moment
* Required "Resources" tracker based on what I can gather on the specified filtered day for my required "Characters" and "Weapons"
* Nav (Left) that takes you to a different pages to look at the different tabs
* Clicking on a "Character" brigns up a menu that allows you to change the current and desired level you wish to make them
*
